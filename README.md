# Advanced Cognitive Neuroscience MEG & fMRI Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains analytical work for the Advanced Cognitive Neuroscience course at Aarhus University. It focuses on analyzing MEG and fMRI brain scans from thought-reading experiments conducted at Aarhus Skejby Hospital, Denmark. The workshop emphasizes the practical application of cognitive neuroscience techniques to understand brain function during specific cognitive tasks.

## Data
The dataset comprises anonymized MEG and fMRI brain scans. Please note that while the data is anonymized to protect participant privacy, it is not available publicly due to ethical and privacy considerations.
## Project Structure
- `MEG_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the analysis of MEG data.
- `fMRI_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook focusing on fMRI data analysis.
- `Data_Annotation.ipynb`: Notebook describing the process of data anonymization and preparation.

## Getting Started
