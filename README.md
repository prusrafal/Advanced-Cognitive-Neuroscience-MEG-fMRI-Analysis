# Advanced Cognitive Neuroscience MEG & fMRI Analysis

## Overview
This repository is part of the coursework for the Advanced Cognitive Neuroscience course at Aarhus University. It centers around a sophisticated analysis of MEG and fMRI brain scans, applying thought-reading experiments data obtained in collaboration with Aarhus Skejby Hospital, Denmark. The analysis employs cutting-edge techniques to decipher brain activity patterns related to cognitive tasks.

## Data
The analysis is based on anonymized MEG and fMRI brain scans. Due to ethical and privacy concerns, the dataset is anonymized and not publicly available. 

## Analysis Notebook
- `rafs_17_Nilearn_faceWord_classification_searchlight_group.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook delves into the classification of face vs. word recognition tasks using Nilearn, focusing on a group-level searchlight analysis. The notebook illustrates the methodological steps and insights drawn from the brain scans.

## Getting Started
To explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure your environment has the necessary Python packages installed (`nilearn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`).
3. Open `rafs_17_Nilearn_faceWord_classification_searchlight_group.ipynb` in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook to view and run the analysis.
